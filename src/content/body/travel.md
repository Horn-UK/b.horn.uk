I've travelled to over 30 countries, doing things such as:

* Backpacking through Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) and the Southern Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia).
* Doing a Internship based around remote sensing in Cape Town, South Africa
* Cultural Exchanges in Oslo (Norway), Helsinki (Finland) and Guangzhou (China)
