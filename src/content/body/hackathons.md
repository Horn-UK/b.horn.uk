I'm heavily involved in the UK hackathon scene, attending over 20 hackathons during my time as an undergraduate, co-founded [CovHack](https://covhack.org) and started the [wiki for hackathons in the uk](https://hack.athon.uk).

You can see some of my projects on my [devpost](https://devpost.com/bahorn)
